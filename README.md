# Relay-MVP
Main goal of this 3 day MVP was go give my 2023 runners a better virtual relay experience than I provided in 2021 using google sheets.

While working to finalize the app for use, I decided to deploy a demo to be able to experience the app from all prespectives at the click of a button or two.
