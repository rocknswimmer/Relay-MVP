# Relay-MVP
Main goal of this 3 day MVP was go give my 2023 runners a better virtual relay experience than I provided in 2021 using google sheets.

Video demo of the app and its need in MVP.mov file.

Need to figure out authentication before being able to deploy, but I wanted to include as much functionality in the limited time and knew I would not use this app for months. The app displays the general informatoin in a much clearner way than in google sheets. My runners are also now able to mark thier legs complete when finished, I did not give edit access with sheets for fear of an accidental delete. I can update all the runner and leg information in the database through the app, as well as adding new ones. This means that I could have this as the only thing I need to share with my runners instead of multiple google sheets.


some new features to think about adding in the future
It would probably benefit my runners if I allowed calling or texting of the other runners in the app.
A variable associated with each user allowing the right time zone to be used for relay times.
